    Fix Copy PGN for chrome
    Apparently on Chrome you need to specify the type of the Blob `{ type: 'text/plain' }`. This seem a bug in Chrome since it apparently work on 112.2 but fail on 112.0.56.
    I've left the `console.log` since it's useful in the future since it should only be triggered when something on our end is not working as expected.
    Tested on Chrome, Safari and Firefox

    the broadcast round we display is not always the one we link to
    > The initial thought was that this would also work when clicking on a broadcast in /broadcast, but when clicking on a broadcast there, it still leads to the upcoming and not the last played round (WCC for example: https://lichess.org/broadcast/fide-world-chess-championship-2023/lrdHUzyS leads to Round 12, but when clicking on it in /broadcast, it forwards to Round 13)
