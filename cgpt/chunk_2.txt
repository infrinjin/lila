    Expand lang regex in route to take into account Kurdish (Kurmanji)
    This add additional complexity on the router side, but I think it's negligible, since those pages are not hit a lot.
    The other solution would be to assign the `ku` lang code to `Kurdish (Kurmanji)` instead of `kmr`, since we do not support other kurdish dialects.
    This solution would potentially be problematic with crowndin though.

    Redirect click on "Learn" top nav button to Chess basics
    Close #12336. I agree with the OP that it makes more sense for beginners and lead to better consistency.
    The "Practice" link was chosen in f3fa4dd70c7bd78ef8133baa6430ddd3bf754bec.

    Make rating range unselectable for provisional ratings
    Those range are ignored anyway by the pairing system. Greying out is better UX than just removing it I think, as with the tooltip they can learn why it's not possible. I'm not sold on the wording of that tooltip, but could not find better without being too lengthy.
